# Data Science Tutorial Project: U.S. Flight Delays

In this project, we analyzed U.S. flight data during past government shutdowns and used the data to predict the potential impacts on flight delays in the 2025 shutdown.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a step by step tutorial that walks through the full data science lifecycle. 

## Approach
We collected and cleaned data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, provided by the US Department of Transportation. We explored patterns across shutdown and non-shutdown periods and applied data analysis techniques. This project is structured to be instructional as well as reproducible.
